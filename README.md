# enterprise-fizzbuzz

Demanding enterprises demand enterprise fizzes and buzzes. Enterprise fizzbuzz meets those demands.


### Why?

This is a humorous project by Tim Post (@tinkertim) to test various things such as:

 - Software documentation systems
 - Continuous integration systems / continuous delivery systems (yes! there will be a fizzbuzz microservice!)
 - Software linting systems
 - Software build configuration systems

... you're starting to get the picture. The goal of this project is to become as bloated and complicated as humanly possible, while keeping
one goal in mind:

 > Always remember the fizzbuzz. Eneterprise fizzbuzz should always do one thing, and exactly one thing, extremely well. 

Pull requests are welcome with appropriate sign-off.


### The Roadmap

Mostly more fizzing and buzzing.
