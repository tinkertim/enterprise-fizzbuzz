<br/>

Currently, Enterprise FizzBuzz supports generic ASCII boxing of the output, which is implemented in the public header as follows:

<br/>

Here, we define a generic ASCII wrapper around the top and bottom of the output, _only_ if one isn't defined elsewhere (e.g. on the command line):

<div style="background: #e5ecff; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px; border-bottom: 1px solid #c1c7d0; border-radius: 4px; color: black">    📄 src/lib/libfizzbuzz/libfizzbuzz.h ✅ Up to Date*

   </div>

```h
⬜ 5       * Controls how the 'printed' iteration list is styled on the top and bottom.
⬜ 6       * Can be overridden via defining the constant on the command line.
⬜ 7       */
🟩 8      #ifndef TOPS_AND_BOTTOMS
🟩 9      #define TOPS_AND_BOTTOMS printf("+-----+------+------+\n");
🟩 10     #endif // TOPS_AND_BOTTOMS
🟩 11     
⬜ 12     /* Public Prototypes */
⬜ 13     void do_fizz_buzz(unsigned int);
⬜ 14     void fizz_buzz(void);
```
<br/>

This means, you can pass `-D TOPS_AND_BOTTOMS` at compile time, and it will take precedence over what is in the header.

Ideally, we only use this as a last resort while the rest of the library isn't implemented fully yet - and we write callers that output XML, JSON and YAML individually.

We'll then implement a fizzbuzz service that just produces fizzing and buzzing output, which the caller can wrap in any method.
