<br/>

In the future, FizzBuzz should:

*   Produce output in XML, JSON or YAML formats natively (without hacky overrides), along with "classic" ASCII.
    
*   Contain a microservice with a small API which callers can use to consume fizzing and buzzing iterations, and relay them as they see fit.
    
*   A suite of unit tests
    
*   Possibly, a kernel module to implement `/dev/fizzbuzz`

This snippet exists just so maintainers are notified by Swimm to check on this document for relevancy if the version ever changes. This is an example of a document that doesn't really have a lot of code tied to it - we're talking about rationale, future directions, things that we tried but didn't work - etc. This is an example of that sort of 'tacit' knowledge that has to stay in sync - even though it's not tied to any specific lines of code, it's still tied TO the code.
