Enterprise Fizzbuzz is a demonstration repo for use with learning the ropes with Swimm. It's a humorous take on what should be a 1-line solution to a simple programming problem:

> Print the numbers 1 to 100.
> 
> If the number is a multiple of 3, print "fizz" next to it.
> 
> If the number is a multiple of 5, print "buzz" next to it.
> 
> If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "fizzbuzz" next to it.

The answer is, of course, to just use the modulus operand to see if 3 or 5 divide evenly into the iteration in the loop, and print accordingly. But we don't stop there, no - we have to make it harder, much much harder than it should be. We're making a core library that handles all the fizzing and buzzing, and then building as many fizzing and buzzing implementations as possible!

Right now, we have this bloated implementation:

<br/>

Here's our current main 'caller'

<div style="background: #e5ecff; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px; border-bottom: 1px solid #c1c7d0; border-radius: 4px; color: black">    📄 src/lib/libfizzbuzz/libfizzbuzz.c ✅ Up to Date*   </div>

```c
⬜ 1      #include <stdio.h>
⬜ 2      #include "libfizzbuzz.h"
⬜ 3      
🟩 4      /**
🟩 5       * Implements the fizzbuzz iterative counter from 1 - requested iterations.
🟩 6       * @param iterations The number of iterations to print
🟩 7       * @return void
🟩 8       */ 
🟩 9      void do_fizz_buzz(unsigned int iterations)
🟩 10     {
🟩 11       unsigned int i;
🟩 12       TOP_AND_BOTTOM;
🟩 13       for(i=1 ; i < iterations - 1; i++)
🟩 14         printf("| %-3d | %-4s | %-4s |\n", i, i%3 ? "" : "Fizz", i%5 ? "" : "Buzz");
🟩 15       TOP_AND_BOTTOM;
🟩 16       return 0;
🟩 17     }
⬜ 18     
⬜ 19     /**
⬜ 20      * Shortcut to iterate 100 times (which is the standard)
```
<br/>

And if you take a look at the header, you'll see the compile-time constant you can tweak to alter formatting:

<br/>

We have selectable formatting implemented in the header, which can be overridden at compile time

<div style="background: #e5ecff; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px; border-bottom: 1px solid #c1c7d0; border-radius: 4px; color: black">    📄 src/lib/libfizzbuzz/libfizzbuzz.h ✅ Up to Date*   </div>

```h
⬜ 1      #ifndef LIBFIZZBUZZ_H
⬜ 2      #define LIBFIZZBUZZ_H
⬜ 3      
🟩 4      /**
🟩 5       * Controls how the 'printed' iteration list is styled on the top and bottom.
🟩 6       * Can be overridden via defining the constant on the command line.
🟩 7       */
🟩 8      #ifndef TOP_AND_BOTTOM
🟩 9      #define TOP_AND_BOTTOM printf("+-----+------+------+\n");
🟩 10     #endif // TOP_AND_BOTTOM
⬜ 11     
⬜ 12     /* Public Prototypes */
⬜ 13     void do_fizz_buzz(unsigned int);
```
<br/>

That's not enough. We need to come up with at least 20 different callers that call `do_fizz_buzz` internally, so that we can provide fizzing and buzzing in many situations, with lots of complexity, overrides that produce unexpected behavior, and lots of tests.
