It's a humorous take on what should be a 1-line solution to a simple programming problem:\n\n> Print the numbers 1 to 100.\n> \n> If the number is a multiple of 3, print \"fizz\" next to it.\n> \n> If the number is a multiple of 5, print \"buzz\" next to it.\n> \n> If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print \"fizzbuzz\" next to it.\n\nThe answer is, of course, to just use the modulus operand to see if 3 or 5 divide evenly into the iteration in the loop, and print accordingly. But we don't stop there, no - we have to make it harder, much much harder than it should be. We're making a core library that handles all the fizzing and buzzing, and then building as many fizzing and buzzing implementations as possible!\n\nRight now, we have this bloated implementation:"
